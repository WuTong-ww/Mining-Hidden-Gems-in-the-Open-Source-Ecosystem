,, test,
,,,
,,,
,,,
,,,
,, and each pull request triggers a CI build on our [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=Fuck-We-Ballerz_DM885). A PR must *always* pass the SonarCloud quality gate; otherwise,
,,,
,,,
,,,
,,,
,,,
,,,
,, or even critical aspects such as security. The following list provides a brief overview of the tasks that need to be addressed:,
,,,
,, and end-to-end tests.,
,,,
,, and the status of the submission.,
,,,
,,,
,, new tasks may emerge and existing ones may become irrelevant.,

,, and it's very easy to implement a new Goblin for a specific environment. All the complex logic is in the Minions,
,,,
,,,
,,,
,,,
,, quickly and at scale. It's likely most,

,, the Overlord and the Minions.,
,,,
,, never let the scanners access a Home directory,
,,,
,, does whatever it needs to and returns back - if any were found - vulnerabilities. A minion has only as much context as it specifically asks for about the target of a scan (more about this below). This allows Minions to be laser-focused on the tasks of detecting vulnerabilities,
,,,
,, in charge of managing incoming scan requests,
